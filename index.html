        <p> Welcome! I am here to help you celebrate your special times with a treat. I started baking in 6th grade and
            made my first wedding cake when I was only 14 years old. My love for baking lead me to get a bachelor's
            degree in Food Science and a master in Food Science focusing on dairy. Now I am stay at home mom which puts
            me in the perfect position to create culinary creation for you. </p>
